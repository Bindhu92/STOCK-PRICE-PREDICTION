STOCK PRICE PREDICTION

Project Overview:


This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model to predict stock prices based on historical market data. Using various predictive modeling techniques, including regression models, deep learning, and time series forecasting, the goal is to build a model that can forecast the future price of a given stock.
The project leverages advanced data analysis techniques and features such as technical indicators, market sentiment, and financial ratios to predict stock movements. It also explores different machine learning models and compares their performance in terms of accuracy, reliability, and generalization capabilities.

Key Features:


Stock Data Collection: Historical stock price data is collected from APIs such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing steps like handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering are performed.
Modeling: A range of machine learning models are applied, including:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for time series forecasting
Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Visualization: Visualizations of stock price trends, predicted vs. actual prices, and model performance are included using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for machine learning models
Keras/TensorFlow for deep learning models (e.g., LSTM)
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
Yahoo Finance API/Alpha Vantage API for data collection

How to Use
Clone the repository:
git clone https:https://github.com/Bindhu92/STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION.git

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Obtain API keys for stock data sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage) and configure the environment.

Run the script to train the model and make predictions:

python train_model.py - Train the model on historical stock data.
python predict.py - Use the trained model to make stock price predictions.
