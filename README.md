STOCK PRICE PREDICTION

OVERVIEW:-
This project aims to predict stock prices using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. It leverages historical stock market data to develop models that forecast future stock prices with improved accuracy.

FEATURES:-

Data collection from financial APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Implementation of predictive models (Linear Regression, LSTM, Random Forest, etc.)

Hyperparameter optimization using Hyperopt and Talos

Performance evaluation and model comparison

INSTALLATION:

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Bindhu92/STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION.git
cd STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

USAGE:

Run the main script to start the stock price prediction process:

python stock_pred_main.py

For hyperparameter optimization:

python stock_pred_hyperopt.py
python stock_pred_talos.py

MODELS IMPLEMENTED:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

XGBoost
